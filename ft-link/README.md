# FT-LINK

The FT-LINK is a generic in-circuit debugger and programmer based on the FT2232H chip. It supports both Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) interfaces. The FT-LINK connects to the host computer through a USB Type-C port, enabling seamless communication with any rocket-chip based FPGA designs.
